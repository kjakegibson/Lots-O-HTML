<h1>We Are Having Fun</h1>


<p>The Army had half a day. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! Way to plant, Ann! So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's Kama Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. Michael, I'm your older brother. I'll never be proud of you.</p>

<h2>Still Having Fun</h2>

<p>I believe you will find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing!  So we don't get dessert? When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome.</p>

<h3>Not So Much Fun</h3>

<p>That's how Tony Wonder lost a nut. Each year, Oscar attempts the four hundred mile walk from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California. In the twelve years that he's attempted this, he's never made it farther than UC Irvine. When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman..</p>

<h4>Please End My Life</h4>

<p>I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with <em>"Fuck Mountain." Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready. Go ahead, touch the Cornballer. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores.</em></p>

<h5>The Sweet Embrace of Death</h5>

<p>I hear <strong>the jury's still out on science. It's Sunday, but screw it — juice box time. In prison, you just have to close your eyes and take it, but here you have to close your eyes and give it. That was Tom Cruise, the actor.</strong> They said he was some kind of scientist. It's a wonderful restaurant! I don't appreciate the dry British humor. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? Let the great experiment begin!</p>

<h6>WOOWWWEEEE RICK</h6>

<p>So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's Kama Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? I'll never forget your wedding. You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. Mission Accomplished. ♪♪ It ain't easy being white. It ain't easy being brown. ♪♪ A lady of the evening. Working girl. She turns illusions for money. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C.</p>
